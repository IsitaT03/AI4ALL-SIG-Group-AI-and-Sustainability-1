## Abstract

Water quality is an extremely important issue that has impacts in many aspects of life. Clean water is needed for humans to drink, for those involved in aquaculture to raise livestock, and is also a metric of environmental pollution and degradation. The ability to predict water quality drops can enable farmers and other consumers of that water to mitigate the outbreaks of disease and protect themselves, both in health and from financial loss.  Certain environmental factors can be utilized as indicators of water quality: Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Conductivity, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrate Amount, and Total Coliform. These are the results of many complex biological processes of the living organisms in the water and the external environment around the water. Machine Learning has shown considerable promise in the area of classification and prediction tasks. Thus, this project experiments with multiple Machine Learning-based techniques to create a model that can accurately predict water quality based on biochemical and environmental factors. The experimental results show a high accuracy in predicting water quality based on the algorithms with real datasets.

The dataset was found via Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/anbarivan/indian-water-quality-analysis-and-prediction/comments). The paper with information about the equations was also found at that link (Al-Akhir, 2020).
